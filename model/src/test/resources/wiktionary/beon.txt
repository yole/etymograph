=====Usage notes=====
* The verbs {{m|ang|bēon}} and {{m|ang|wesan}} both mean to [[be]], but in different circumstances. For most purposes, {{m|ang|wesan}} is used; {{m|ang|bēon}} is used for what is known as the "[[Wikipedia:Gnomic_aspect|gnomic]] present" and the future tense of to [[be]].
** The gnomic present, in short, refers to anything which is a general truth, like ''Winter <u>biþ</u> ċealdost'' ("Winter <u>is</u> coldest"), or ''Fēower sīðum seofon <u>bēoþ</u> eahta and twēntiġ'' ("Four times seven <u>is</u> (lit. "<u>are</u>") twenty-eight"). Generally, statements about the self will not be gnomic. For example, although it may seem that a statement like ''I <u>am</u> a person'' is always true, such a statement is nonetheless rendered with {{m|ang|wesan}}: ''Iċ <u>eom</u> mann''.
** To [[be]] is the only verb in Old English for which the future tense may be indicated with morphology instead of adverbs or context clues, and for this purpose, {{m|ang|bēon}} is used. So, ''I <u>am</u> the king'' is rendered as ''Iċ <u>eom</u> sē cyning'', but ''I <u>will be</u> the king'' is rendered as ''Iċ <u>bēo</u> sē cyning''. Note that {{m|ang|bēon}} is ''not'' used for any other verb's future tense; both ''I <u>see</u> it'' and ''I <u>will see</u> it'' are written as ''Iċ hit <u>ġesēo</u>''.
** Both {{m|ang|bēon}} and {{m|ang|wesan}} share past tense forms.
* Both {{m|ang|bēon}} and {{m|ang|wesan}} are copulative verbs, which means they are not transitive and do not take a direct object. Because of this, predicate nouns and adjectives will be in the [[nominative]] case. For example: ''Hēo <u>is</u> iċ'' ("She <u>is</u> I"), not ''*Hēo <u>is</u> mē'' ("She <u>is</u> me").
