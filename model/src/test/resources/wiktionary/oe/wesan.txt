==Old English==

===Alternative forms===
* {{alter|ang|weosan||Anglian}}
* {{alter|ang|wesa|wosa|uosa|wossa|uossa}}

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|ang|gmw-pro|*wesan}}, from {{inh|ang|gem-pro|*wesaną}}, from {{der|ang|ine-pro|*h₂wes-}}.

The simple present forms originate from {{der|ang|ine-pro|*h₁es-||to be}}, which had no infinitive or past tense in Proto-Germanic, but had already formed a single paradigm with {{m|gem-pro|*wesaną}} supplying the infinitive and past tense.

=====Usage notes=====
* The verbs {{m|ang|bēon}} and {{m|ang|wesan}} both mean to [[be]], but in different circumstances. For most purposes, {{m|ang|wesan}} is used; {{m|ang|bēon}} is used for what is known as the "[[Wikipedia:Gnomic_aspect|gnomic]] present" and the future tense of to [[be]].
** The gnomic present, in short, refers to anything which is a general truth, like ''Winter <u>biþ</u> ċealdost'' ("Winter <u>is</u> coldest"), or ''Fēower sīðum seofon <u>bēoþ</u> eahta and twēntiġ'' ("Four times seven <u>is</u> (lit. "<u>are</u>") twenty-eight"). Generally, statements about the self will not be gnomic. For example, although it may seem that a statement like ''I <u>am</u> a person'' is always true, such a statement is nonetheless rendered with {{m|ang|wesan}}: ''Iċ <u>eom</u> mann''.
** To [[be]] is the only verb in Old English for which the future tense may be indicated with morphology instead of adverbs or context clues, and for this purpose, {{m|ang|bēon}} is used. So, ''I <u>am</u> the king'' is rendered as ''Iċ <u>eom</u> sē cyning'', but ''I <u>will be</u> the king'' is rendered as ''Iċ <u>bēo</u> sē cyning''. Note that {{m|ang|bēon}} is ''not'' used for any other verb's future tense; both ''I <u>see</u> it'' and ''I <u>will see</u> it'' are written as ''Iċ hit <u>ġesēo</u>''.
** Both {{m|ang|bēon}} and {{m|ang|wesan}} share past tense forms.
* Both {{m|ang|bēon}} and {{m|ang|wesan}} are copulative verbs, which means they are not transitive and do not take a direct object. Because of this, predicate nouns and adjectives will be in the [[nominative]] case. For example: ''Hēo <u>is</u> iċ'' ("She <u>is</u> I"), not ''*Hēo <u>is</u> mē'' ("She <u>is</u> me").
* In the Anglian dialects, the present plural indicative form {{m|ang|earon}} occurred alongside the {{m|ang|sind}}/{{m|ang|sindon}} forms. This may have been due to influence or loaning from the Old Norse cognate {{m|non|vera}}/{{m|non|vesa}}, or it may be an earlier native form that was lost entirely in the southern dialects.
* A regularised form ''wesaþ'' is also rarely attested for the present plural indicative, perhaps representing a [[hypercorrection]] due to influence from the infinitive and/or the imperative plural form (the latter being identical to the present plural indicative for most other Old English verbs).

===Etymology 2===
From {{inh|ang|gmw-pro|*wesan}}, from {{inh|ang|gem-pro|*wesaną|t=to consume, feast|id=consume}}, derived from {{der|ang|ine-pro|*wes-|t=to graze|id=graze}}.<ref>{{R:gem:EDPG|head=Wesan- 2}}</ref> The only (possible) attestation is in the form {{m|ang|weaxan}} in line 3115 of ''[[s:Beowulf_(Harrison_and_Sharp)#WĪGLAF_SPEAKS._THE_BUILDING_OF_THE_BALE-FIRE.|Beowulf]]'', argued to be a misspelling of {{m|ang|weosan}}.<ref>{{R:gem:Seebold|head=WES-A- 2|passage=562-63}}</ref>
